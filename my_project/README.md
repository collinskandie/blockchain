# Secure Hierarchical RBAC Application with Blockchain Integration

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a Secure Hierarchical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Application with Blockchain Integration for Smart Manufacturing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.x): [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Python library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain (if using Ethereum)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/): Smart contract language (if using Ethereum)
- [Blockchain Node](https://geth.ethereum.org/): A blockchain node or access to a blockchain network (if using Ethereum)
- Any additional libraries and dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file

## Installation

1. Unzip files to your local machine:

   ```bash
   use winrar
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd smy_project
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your blockchain connection details in the `config.py` file (if applicable):

   ```python
   # Example for Ethereum
   BLOCKCHAIN_URL = "http://localhost:8545"  # Ethereum node URL
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x123456789ABCDEF"  # Smart contract address
   CONTRACT_ABI = [...]  # ABI of the smart contract
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
